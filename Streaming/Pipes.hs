{-| "Pipes.Group.Tutorial" is the correct introduction to the use of this module,
    which is mostly just an optimized @Pipes.Group@, replacing @FreeT@ with @Stream@. 
    The module also includes optimized functions for interoperation:

> fromStream :: Monad m => Stream (Of a) m r -> Producer' a m r
> toStream :: Monad m => Producer a m r -> Stream (Of a) m r
    .
    It is not a drop in replacement for @Pipes.Group@. The only systematic difference
    is that this simple module omits lenses. It is hoped that this will
    may make elementary usage easier to grasp. The lenses exported the pipes packages
    only come into their own with the simple @StateT@ parsing procedure pipes promotes. 
    We are not attempting here to replicate this advanced procedure, but only to make 
    elementary forms of breaking and splitting possible in the simplest possible way.
    .
    The @pipes-group@ tutorial 
    is framed as a hunt for a genuinely streaming
    @threeGroups@, which would collect the first three groups of matching items while
    never holding more than the present item in  memory. 
    The formulation it opts for in the end would 
    be expressed here thus:

> import Pipes
> import Streaming.Pipes 
> import qualified Pipes.Prelude as P
>
> threeGroups :: (Monad m, Eq a) => Producer a m () -> Producer a m ()
> threeGroups = concats . takes 3 . groups

   The program splits the initial producer into a connected stream of
   producers containing  "equal" values; it takes three of those; and then
   erases the effects of splitting. So for example

>>> runEffect $ threeGroups (each "aabccoooooo") >-> P.print
'a'
'a'
'b'
'c'
'c'
 
   The new user might look at the examples of splitting, breaking and joining
   in @Streaming.Prelude@ keeping in mind that @Producer a m r@ is equivalent
   to @Stream (Of a) m r@.
   .
   For the rest, only part of the tutorial that would need revision is 
   the bit at the end about writing explicit @FreeT@ programs. Here one does
   not proceed by pattern matching, but uses `inspect` in place of `runFreeT`

> inspect :: (Monad m, Functor f) => Stream f m r -> m (Either r (f (Stream f m r)))

   and for construction of a @Stream (Producer a m) m r@, the usual battery of combinators: 

> wrap   :: (Monad m, Functor f) => f (Stream f m r) -> Stream f m r
> effect :: (Monad m, Functor f) => m (Stream f m r) -> Stream f m r
> yields :: (Monad m, Functor f) => f r -> Stream f m r
> lift   :: (Monad m, Functor f) => m r -> Stream f m r 

   and so on.
